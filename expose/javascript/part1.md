# Part 1

1. `values added:  20`
2. `final result:  20`
3. `values added:  20`
4. Error since result is not defined outside the scope of the if statement but the console.log statement is outside the block.
5. We never get to line 9 since at there is an error before that. Result was declared as a constant equals to 0 but in line 7 the code is trying to modify the constant.
6. We also never get to line 13 because of the error on line 7.
